# AWD-Web-project-

Following the pandemic of COVID19 many have found it difficult to follow their task in work, in this framework I thought of elaborating a professional network, to endorse my skills of programming in PHP, so that the researchers can make their tasks at distance. 
This project is also valid outside of this pandemic because we can through consulting the time of activity and the database shared between researchers, communicate, publish and react on the publications.
