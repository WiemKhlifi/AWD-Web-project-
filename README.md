# AWD (professional network within a laboratory) 

Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many had difficulties in keeping up with their tasks at work. In this context, I thought of developing a professional network to improve my programming skills in PHP, so that researchers can perform their tasks remotely. This project is also valid outside this pandemic because they can consult their activity time and the database shared between them also communicate, publish, and react to publications.
