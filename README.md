# AWD-Web-project-

Following the pandemic of COVID-19, many have found it difficult to follow their tasks at work. In this framework, I thought of elaborating a professional network to endorse my skills in programming in PHP, so that the researchers can do their tasks at a distance. This project is also valid outside of this pandemic because we can, through consulting the time of activity and the database shared between researchers, communicate, publish, and react to the publications.
